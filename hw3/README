Assignment 3 -  LALR(1) Parser using bison

I don't think my Makefile is properly linking the files, since I
keep getting an error that " 'astree' does not name a type ", which
makes it seem like the necessary header file isn't getting included.
Annoyingly made it so I was never able to actually test my code, so I
had to do it to the extent that I thought was correct.
