Assignment 1 -  String Set and Preprocessor

After submitting, I accidentally created an empty file
in the submissions directory by calling vi on main.cpp,
a nonexistent file. However, I don't have permission to
remove that file from the directory, so I'm just using
this as a way to make sure you know to remove that empty
file before running my program on my actual main.cpp file.

Thanks!
